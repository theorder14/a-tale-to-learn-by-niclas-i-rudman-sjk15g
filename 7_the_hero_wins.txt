Out from nowhere a hermit comes out. Didrik the helper is apparently his name.
The hero explains the situation and Didrik laughs.

This isnt fun, the hero exclaims, "dont mock me" he screams. "Tell me how can i defeat the evil sorcery of the mirrors" he begs.
Mirrors are only a reflection of this world, its yourself you see, the hermit explains.

"You need to make a choice, drink this and you can save the princess but you will forever be ugly, 
or turn around and keep your beauty but leave the princess to her fate."
The hero drinks the drink and saves the princess.
