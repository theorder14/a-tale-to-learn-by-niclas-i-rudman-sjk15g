A sunny day in July in some year? the handsome hero Niclas(Niclas Ivarus RudamumusJava which was his full name btw) was 
walking in his big beautiful garden. His favorite hobby was to work in the garden among his unique flowers and 
green/purple/blue/black/pink- grass that he had invented. 

Many people were jealous on his garden and when they asked him how he invented the unique color theme, he always said: 
"The trick to invent these color themes to both the flowers and the grass is to smile to god and just being beautiful, 
also you need to be able to get the faint-reaction from women when they see your upperbody and yeah ofcourse you need
to be a MAN!! ;)". 

Yeah anywayz..... this particular sunny July day came a mail on his gmail.
In the mail it stood: 
"Hello Niclas Ivarus RudamumusJava the mighty and beautiful!
I have a quest for you which dont involve mirrors, as I know that you are afraid of.
You have to go and save a princess in a castle somewhere."

Thnx in advance Alvaro Foresti, Jensen Education.
