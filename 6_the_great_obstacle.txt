At last the hero reach the castle, but something is wrong. The sun is reflecting from the castle, it should be snow all around the castle but it has melted. 

In horror the hero sees that the villian has found out his weakness. He cant go any closer, the castle is made out of mirrors. 
The walls, the towers, even the courtyard floor from the looks of it, all mirrors.

Last time the hero saw a mirror up close he almost died from starvation after looking into it for 40 days straight. 
He got entranced by the beautiful being on the otherside, how could something be so perfect.
